# RandomWarzone

## Introduction
RandomWarzone is an iOs App that allows users to stay in touch and craete random warzone loadout challenges for the squads they game with. A user can keep track of the regiments they joined as well as their squads they game with. 

## What the App can do:
- Generate a random loadout for the user
- Create or join squads and regiments
- Add friends
- View and stay in touch with their squad

## What still needs to be done:
- Add the remaining loadout weapons
- Add the random challenges for squads and regiments. When a squad decides to do a random loadout challenge they can choose between all getting the same random loadout, each getting their own random loadout, or choose a random loadout for each other

## Future ideas?
- A way of keeping track how that game went with the random loadout challenge. Squads can receive rewards for achieving random loadout challenges.
